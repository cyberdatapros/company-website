export const policyHtml = `<p>This Privacy Policy governs the way CyberData Pros, and its affiliates and subsidiaries&nbsp;collects, uses, maintains, and discloses information collected from users (each, a “User”) of the cyberdatapros.com website, and its related social media accounts (collectively, the “Sites”).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>WHAT INFORMATION IS COVERED BY THIS POLICY?</strong></p><p>CyberData Pros collects two overall types of data: 1) Customer Data, such as user data of CyberData Pros customers, in CyberData Pros provision of services to its customers; and 2) User Data from visitors to its website.&nbsp;This is an important distinction that will continually be made in Privacy Policy because the applicability of certain provisions, and awareness of additional contractual terms between CyberData Pros and its customers, will depend on whether the data in question is either User Data, or Customer Data.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. CYBERDATA PROS CUSTOMER USER DATA</strong></p><p>At times, and to allow CyberData Pros to do its job, CyberData Pros may receive identifiable personal information for those purposes outlined in its agreements with customers (“Customer Data”). Those agreements between CyberData Pros and its customers, in addition to applicable provisions of this Privacy Policy, govern what CyberData Pros does with Customer Data. Regardless, CyberData Pros does not use Customer Data for any purpose other than: 1) as permitted by customer agreements; and/or 2) on behalf of its customers in combination with personal information received from one or more other CyberData Pros customers to the extent necessary to detect data security incidents or protect against fraudulent or illegal activity. The privacy policies of CyberData Pros respective customers govern rights of consumers as to the personal information they may have previously provided to them, and that therefore may be present in some of the Customer Data processed by CyberData Pros. CyberData Pros customers are asked in agreements with CyberData Pros to acknowledge their own compliance with applicable law in collection of data from their own users, and provision of such data to CyberData Pros for use in the services CyberData Pros provides.</p><p>Responding to Consumer Requests: CyberData Pros receive a request to know or a request to delete from a consumer (or other similar request) regarding personal information contained in the Customer Data CyberData Pros collects, maintains, or sells on behalf of its customer(s), CyberData Pros will defer its response to such request to the applicable customer(s) (if any) so that the customer can carry out appropriate verification of the request, assessment, and resulting actions with respect to all of the requestor’s personal information (and not just that portion maintained or processed by CyberData Pros). In compliance with applicable law, CyberData Pros will inform the requestor that it should submit any such request directly to the business on whose behalf CyberData Pros processes the information (if any) and, when feasible, provide the requestor with contact information for that customer.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Purposes of Data Processing.&nbsp;</em>We process Customer Data for Business Services only in accordance with customer’s instructions, including any applicable terms in a customer’s agreement, and as required by law. CyberData Pros is always a processor of Customer Data; CyberData Pros customer is always the controller. We may therefore need to access Customer Data to provide the Services, to prevent or address service or technical problems, to respond to customer support matters, to follow the instructions of our customer who submitted Customer Data, or in response to contractual requirements with our customers. As set forth in this privacy Policy, CyberData Pros uses Other Information in furtherance of our legitimate interests in operating our Services, Sites, and business.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Questions or Complaints</em>. If you are a resident of a European country and you believe we maintain your personal data, you may direct any questions or complaints concerning compliance to the email or physical address provided at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.</p><p><em>Rights of Access and Choice</em>.&nbsp;Some international users have certain legal rights to access certain personal data we hold about them and to obtain its correction, amendment, or deletion. Those users may exercise some of those rights through the options described in our Privacy Policy, but since CyberData Pros has a limited ability to identify and access an individual user’s personal data that a CyberData Pros customer has submitted to the Services, if you wish to request access, to limit use, or to limit disclosure, we may first refer your request to the customer(s) who provided your personal data to CyberData Pros, and we will support them as needed in responding to your request.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Requirement to Disclose</em>. We may disclose personal data when we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: conform to legal requirements or to respond to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements; or to enforce our contractual obligations.</p><p><em>Sites Not intended For Use In Europe.&nbsp;</em>We control and operate the Sites from the United States and Canada, and the Sites are not marketed to, intended to be utilized by, nor intended to be subject to the laws or jurisdiction of any country or territory in the European Union (EU) or European Economic Area (EEA). Other than as provided herein, CyberData Pros does not represent or warrant that the Sites are appropriate for use in the EU/EEA, and those who choose to access the Sites or use our Service from the EU/EEA do so at their own initiative and are responsible for complying with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. The interpretation and enforcement of this Policy shall not be governed by the rules and regulations applicable to the EU/EEA.</p><p><br></p><p>The remainder of this Privacy Policy is primarily applicable to what has been described above as User Data collected by CyberData Pros on its Sites, rather than Customer Data. If you have any questions about Customer Data or wish to request that CyberData Pros provide you with contact information for those of its customers who may have provided CyberData Pros with your personal information, please contact us at the address, telephone number, or email provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2.
